            <h3 class="bodyExplainText">I was chosen as the Scrum Master of my respective group when the project began, it was the teachers whom had made the groups and chosen the Scrum Masters. I thought the title would make me important or the leader of the project but in reality it made me responsible for the work and workflow. And after the group got together I was very happy, all of the people who I worked with were people I could call my friends now. I couldnt have chosen a better group, especially after the wreck of a group I had the project before.</h3>
            <video controls loop src="Monkey Survivors Trailer.mp4" class="trailer"></video>
            <h3 class="bodyExplainText">My additions to the game were the saving system, the system that picked up materials/xp, me and Simon made the shooting system and I made the system that the shooting uses to target the closest enemy. Alkan did alot of bugfixing which really helped us and he did things like the Movement, Camera, Pausing and Object Pooling. Simon almost all of the weapons and helped the group with choosing and creating guns. Rinze did all the sounds, sprites and animations which really added to the feel of our game. Jorick had made alot of the weapon sprites, the map generation, time system and the crafting system.</h3>
